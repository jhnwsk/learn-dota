# Hoodwink Guide

Hoodwink is a ranged intelligence hero who excels at dealing burst damage and controlling enemies from a distance. She's a playful squirrel-like creature with a mischievous personality and a deadly crossbow.

## Lore and Personality

Hoodwink is a nimble critter from the enchanted forest who has made it her mission to protect the woodland from those who would exploit it. Armed with her trusty crossbow and an arsenal of tricky abilities, she ambushes her enemies with acorns, traps, and one very powerful sniper shot.

She's characterized by:
- Playful, sarcastic voice lines
- A trickster personality
- Deep love for the forest and its creatures
- Surprising ferocity despite her cute appearance

## Role: Position 4 Support

Hoodwink typically plays as a **Position 4 (Soft Support)**. This means:
- You roam between lanes to help secure kills
- You don't need much gold to be effective
- Your abilities provide damage AND control
- You set up kills for your cores with Bushwhack

She can also be played as a Position 3 (Offlaner) or even mid, but Position 4 is the most beginner-friendly role.

## Abilities Breakdown

### Q - Acorn Shot

**What it does:** Hoodwink fires an acorn that bounces between enemies, dealing damage with each bounce. If the acorn hits a tree, it bounces to nearby enemies. If it hits the ground, it plants a tree first!

**Key points:**
- Bounces up to 6 times
- Each bounce does full damage
- Can create a tree for your W (Bushwhack) combo
- Great harassment tool in lane

**Tips:**
- Click directly on an enemy hero to target them
- Click on the ground near enemies to plant a tree first
- Combo: Plant tree → immediately use Bushwhack on the tree

### W - Bushwhack

**What it does:** Hoodwink throws a trap that latches to a nearby tree. Enemies caught in the area are dragged toward the tree, damaged, and stunned.

**Key points:**
- Only works near trees!
- Stuns and damages enemies
- Your most important ability
- Amazing for setting up kills

**Tips:**
- Always aim near a tree
- Combo with Acorn Shot's tree for guaranteed hits
- Use in jungle paths where trees are plentiful
- Great for interrupting enemy channels

### E - Scurry

**What it does:** Passively gives Hoodwink a chance to evade attacks when near trees. When activated, grants bonus movement speed and tree-walking (move through trees).

**Key points:**
- Passive evasion near trees
- Active gives move speed and lets you walk through trees
- Great for escaping or repositioning
- Low mana cost

**Tips:**
- Use to escape through tree lines
- Position fights near trees for the evasion bonus
- Don't waste it just for movement speed - save for escapes
- Can be used to find creative gank angles

### R - Sharpshooter (Ultimate)

**What it does:** Hoodwink charges up her crossbow and fires a devastating shot in a straight line. The longer you charge, the more damage and slow it deals. The shot breaks trees it passes through.

**Key points:**
- Charge for up to 5 seconds
- Max charge = max damage
- Applies a slow and "break" (disables passive abilities)
- You can move slowly while charging

**Tips:**
- Charge from fog of war (where enemies can't see you)
- Don't always max charge - sometimes quick shots are better
- Use after Bushwhack for an easy hit on stunned enemies
- Great for sniping low-health enemies running away

## Tips for Playing Hoodwink

### The Q-W Combo
1. Use Acorn Shot (Q) on the ground near an enemy
2. Immediately cast Bushwhack (W) on the tree it creates
3. This guarantees a stun since you control the tree placement

### Positioning
- Stay near trees for Scurry's evasion
- Fight at the edge of fights, not in the middle
- Use tree lines for surprise attacks

### When to Use Sharpshooter
- On stunned/rooted enemies (easy to hit)
- To finish off fleeing enemies
- In team fights on grouped enemies
- From fog of war for surprise damage

### General Tips
- Don't forget you can walk through trees with Scurry
- Iron Branches can plant trees for emergency Bushwhacks
- Your right-clicks also hurt - don't just rely on abilities
- In team fights, prioritize landing Bushwhack on multiple enemies

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using Bushwhack with no trees nearby** - It won't work!
2. **Overcharging Sharpshooter** - Sometimes a quick shot is better
3. **Fighting away from trees** - You lose your evasion and combo potential
4. **Rushing in first** - You're squishy, let tankier heroes initiate
5. **Forgetting Scurry** - Use it to escape, don't die with it available

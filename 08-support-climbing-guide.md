# Climbing as a Support: Crusader to Legend

A coaching guide for position 4/5 players with 3000+ hours stuck in the Crusader/Archon bracket.

---

## The Hard Truth

You have 3000-4000 hours. You understand the game conceptually. You're still Crusader/Archon. This means you're not lacking knowledge—you're lacking **execution** and **consistency**.

At this bracket, games aren't lost because someone didn't know Disruptor's Glimpse range. They're lost because:
- Supports die with spells unused
- Vision is reactive, not proactive
- Lane presence is passive
- Teamfight positioning is poor

Let's fix that.

---

## Phase 1: Stop Dying Stupidly

**This is the highest-impact change you can make.**

At Crusader/Archon, supports average 8-12 deaths per game. Cut that to 5-6 and your win rate climbs immediately.

### The Death Audit

After every death, ask:
1. Did I have vision of the threat? If no → vision problem
2. Did I use my spells before dying? If no → positioning problem
3. Was I alone? If yes → map awareness problem
4. Did my death accomplish anything? If no → decision problem

### Practical Rules

- **Never walk into fog alone after 10 minutes** unless you've seen 4+ enemies on the map
- **Never stand still in teamfights** - always be repositioning
- **Stay on the edge** - your job is to cast spells and not die, not to right-click

### Hero-Specific Survival

| Hero | Key Survival Tool | When to Use It |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| Vengeful Spirit | Swap | Save it for counter-initiation, not initiation |
| Disruptor | Glimpse | Self-glimpse isn't a thing, but Kinetic Field + TP can be |
| Lich | Frost Shield | Cast on yourself when focused |
| Jakiro | Ice Path | Cut off pursuit paths, don't aim for heroes |
| Venomancer | Plague Wards | Use as scouts, not just push |

---

## Phase 2: Win Your Lane

You have two jobs in lane:
1. Keep your carry alive and farming
2. Make the enemy offlaner's life miserable

### Trading 101

At level 1-2, most offlaners cannot trade with two heroes. **Be aggressive.**

- Right-click the offlaner when they go for last hits
- Stand between the creep wave and the offlaner
- Only pull when the lane is pushing OR you need regen

### The Pull Timing Trap

Bad supports pull on autopilot. Good supports pull with purpose.

**Pull when:**
- Lane is pushing toward enemy tower
- You need regen and can't afford to leave
- Offlaner is dead or in base

**Don't pull when:**
- Lane is already at your tower
- Your carry is being pressured
- You haven't placed aggressive wards yet

### Lane Presence Checklist (First 5 Minutes)

- [ ] Traded damage with enemy offlaner at least 5 times
- [ ] Placed at least one ward that spots enemy rotations
- [ ] Communicated with carry about pull timing
- [ ] Secured or denied ranged creep when possible
- [ ] Used at least one salve/tango set aggressively (for trading, not passive regen)

## Phase 3: Vision Wins Games

At Crusader/Archon, teams average 15-20 observer wards placed per game. The team with more useful vision wins more often.

### Vision Philosophy

**Reactive vision**: Warding where the enemy was
**Proactive vision**: Warding where the enemy will be

You need to be proactive.

### The 3-Zone System

Divide the map into three zones based on game state:

1. **Defensive** (you're behind): Ward your own jungle entrances, triangle, high ground approaches
2. **Neutral** (even game): Ward river, Roshan, enemy jungle edges
3. **Aggressive** (you're ahead): Ward enemy jungle, behind enemy towers, their triangle

### Ward Timing Rules

- **Before objectives**: Always ward Roshan 60 seconds before you want to take it
- **After kills**: If you kill 2+ enemies, immediately ward aggressively
- **After deaths**: If you die, mentally note where you needed vision

### Deward Economy

Sentries cost 50 gold. Killing a ward gives 100 gold + denies vision.

**Always carry 2 sentries.** Deward when:
- Your team keeps getting ganked in the same area
- You're about to take an objective
- You notice enemy support just walked into fog and came back

## Phase 4: Teamfight Execution

Your hero pool (Venge, Disruptor, Lich, Jakiro, Veno) are all **teamfight heroes**. Your value comes from getting your spells off effectively.

### The Spell Priority Framework

Before every fight, know:
1. **Who do I need to save?** (Swap, Glimpse, Frost Shield target)
2. **Who do I need to disable?** (Static Storm, Ice Path target)
3. **What's the kill target?** (Stack your damage there)

### Positioning by Hero

**Vengeful Spirit**
- Stay behind your cores
- Hold Swap for counter-initiation (saving your carry > swapping their carry)
- Aura range matters - don't be so far back you're useless

**Disruptor**
- Stay at max cast range
- Glimpse is your best spell - use it to cancel TPs, isolate targets, save allies
- Static Storm AFTER the fight starts, not to initiate (unless you have Aghs and they have key channelers)

**Lich**
- Frost Shield your initiator or whoever's getting focused
- Chain Frost in chokepoints, not open areas
- Stay alive - your right clicks and slows matter in extended fights

**Jakiro**
- Ice Path is setup - coordinate with team
- Macropyre zones, not damages - use it to cut retreat paths
- You're tanky for a support - you can afford to be slightly forward

**Venomancer**
- Wards BEFORE the fight for vision and chip damage
- Gale is your key disable - hit multiple heroes if possible
- In teamfights, just stay alive and let passive damage tick

## Phase 5: Game Sense and Timing

### The 3-Second Minimap Rule

Glance at the minimap every 3 seconds. Not when something happens—constantly.

If you haven't seen an enemy in 15 seconds, assume they're coming for you or your carry.

### Objective Timing

| Time | What Should Be Happening |
|------|--------------------------|
| 0:00 | Bounty runes, block camps if useful |
| 3:00 | First catapult wave, potential dive |
| 5:00 | Assess lane, rotate if won |
| 7:00 | First power rune that matters (water runes done) |
| 10:00 | Laning phase ending, look for smokes |
| 14:00 | Tormentor spawns, first glyph refresh |
| 20:00 | Roshan timing window opens (game dependent) |

### Smoke Timing

At your bracket, smokes are underused. **Be the one who buys and calls smokes.**

Smoke when:
- You have a level/item advantage
- Key enemy spells are on cooldown (you saw them used)
- You've just cleared enemy vision
- Before Roshan

---

## Phase 6: Hero Pool Optimization

Your pool is fine, but consider this:

### High-Impact Additions

**Witch Doctor** - Similar to your pool but with huge teamfight ultimate. Death Ward wins fights at this bracket because enemies don't disengage.

**Shadow Shaman** - Shackles and wards push objectives. At Crusader/Archon, teams don't close games. SS forces the issue.

**Treant Protector** - Global presence, vision, and save potential. Your cores will do stupid things—Living Armor helps them survive their mistakes.

### When to Pick What

| Situation | Pick |
|-----------|------|
| Enemy has squishy backline | Vengeful Spirit |
| Enemy has mobile heroes | Disruptor |
| Your carry needs protection | Lich |
| You need push + teamfight | Jakiro |
| Long game expected | Venomancer |

## The 30-Day Climb Plan

### Week 1: Death Reduction
- Focus: Die less than 6 times per game
- Review: Watch your deaths in replay, categorize them

### Week 2: Lane Dominance
- Focus: Win your lane or at least go even
- Review: Did your carry have free farm at 10 min?

### Week 3: Vision Game
- Focus: End every game with 20+ observers placed
- Review: Did you have vision before every death?

### Week 4: Teamfight Impact
- Focus: Get all your spells off in every fight
- Review: Watch teamfights at 0.5x speed, count spell usage

### After 30 Days
- Re-evaluate rank
- Identify weakest area from above
- Repeat focused practice on that area

## Final Notes

You have the hours. You have the knowledge. What you need is **discipline**—consistent execution of the fundamentals.

Stop playing for MMR. Start playing for improvement. The MMR will follow.

## Practice Checklist

Before ranked, ask yourself:

- [ ] Am I mentally focused? (no tilt, no distractions)
- [ ] Do I have a hero in mind that fits my team?
- [ ] Do I know my one focus for this game?
- [ ] Am I ready to mute and move on if teammates are toxic?

# Your First Game

Ready to play your first Dota 2 match? This guide will walk you through everything step by step. We recommend starting with bot matches to learn without pressure.

## Starting a Bot Match

1. **Launch Dota 2** from Steam
2. Click **Play** in the main menu
3. Select **Play vs Bots** (Co-op Bot Match)
4. Choose **Easy** or **Passive** bot difficulty
5. Click **Find Match**

## Recommended Beginner Settings

Before your first game, adjust these settings:

### In Options > Game
- Enable **Auto-Attack: Standard** (helps with last-hitting)
- Enable **Double-Tap to Self-Cast** (useful for protective spells)

### In Options > Interface
- Increase **Minimap Size** (awareness is important)
- Enable **Show Health Bars**

### In Options > Hotkeys
- Make sure you're comfortable with ability keys (default: Q, W, E, R)
- Know your item hotkeys (default: Z, X, C, V, B, N)

## Hero Selection

For your first game, we recommend **Hoodwink**! (See our [Hoodwink Guide](04-hoodwink-guide.md))

If Hoodwink is unavailable, other beginner-friendly heroes include:
- **Sniper** - Simple ranged carry
- **Wraith King** - Tanky with only one active ability
- **Crystal Maiden** - Straightforward support

## The First 10 Minutes

### Minute 0: Game Start
1. **Buy starting items** at the fountain
   - For Hoodwink: Tangos, Magic Stick, Faerie Fire, Iron Branch x2
2. **Check your lane assignment** (ask teammates or pick an empty lane)
3. **Walk to your lane** (don't use abilities to get there faster)

### Minutes 1-5: Laning Phase
1. **Stay in your lane** near your creeps
2. **Focus on last-hitting** enemy creeps for gold
3. **Use your abilities** on enemy heroes when they get too close
4. **Don't overextend** - stay near your tower if in danger
5. **Use healing items** (Tangos) when your health gets low

### Minutes 5-10: Continuing to Farm
1. **Buy more items** when you have enough gold
2. **Watch the minimap** for missing enemies
3. **Help nearby fights** if you can get there safely
4. **Don't die** - deaths give the enemy gold and XP

## Basic Objectives Checklist

Use this checklist for your early games:

### During Laning (0-10 minutes)
- [ ] Buy starting items
- [ ] Go to your lane
- [ ] Try to last-hit creeps
- [ ] Don't die unnecessarily
- [ ] Use your abilities on enemies when safe
- [ ] Keep your health and mana up

### Early-Mid Game (10-20 minutes)
- [ ] Complete at least one full item
- [ ] Help your team in fights
- [ ] Take towers when possible
- [ ] Keep farming when not fighting

### Mid-Late Game (20+ minutes)
- [ ] Stick with your team more
- [ ] Focus on objectives (towers, barracks)
- [ ] Participate in big team fights
- [ ] Push to destroy the Ancient when winning fights

## What To Do When...

### You're Low on Health
1. Use healing items (Tangos, Healing Salve)
2. Walk back to your tower
3. If very low, return to fountain using TP scroll or walking

### An Enemy Hero Is Attacking You
1. Fight back if you can win
2. Run toward your tower if you can't
3. Use abilities to escape or slow them

### You Died
1. Don't panic - everyone dies
2. Think about what went wrong
3. When you respawn, buy items and return to lane
4. Be more careful about positioning

### You're Not Sure What To Do
1. Farm creeps (lane or jungle)
2. Look at the minimap for fights
3. Follow your teammates
4. When in doubt, don't engage alone

## Common First-Game Mistakes

1. **Ignoring last-hits** - Just standing in lane without farming
2. **Dying to towers** - Towers hurt! Don't chase under them
3. **Running out of mana** - Don't spam abilities randomly
4. **Wandering alone** - Stick with team in mid-late game
5. **Not using items** - Remember to use your active items!

## After Your First Game

Win or lose, you've taken the first step. Here's what to do next:

1. **Play more bot games** until comfortable
2. **Read the Hoodwink guide** for hero-specific tips
3. **Try one new hero** after several games
4. **Eventually try unranked** matches against real players

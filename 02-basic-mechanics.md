# Basic Mechanics

Understanding these core mechanics is essential for playing Dota 2. Don't worry about mastering everything at once - focus on understanding the concepts first.

## The Map

The Dota 2 map is divided into several key areas:

### Three Lanes
- **Top Lane** - Runs along the top edge of the map
- **Middle Lane (Mid)** - Runs diagonally through the center
- **Bottom Lane (Bot)** - Runs along the bottom edge of the map

Each lane has **towers** that must be destroyed to advance toward the enemy base.

### The Jungle
The areas between the lanes are called the "jungle." Here you'll find:
- **Neutral Creep Camps** - Monsters that give gold and XP when killed
- **Outposts** - Capturable structures that provide vision and XP

### The River
A river runs through the middle of the map, separating Radiant and Dire territory. Important river features:
- **Runes** - Power-ups that spawn periodically
- **Roshan's Pit** - Home of Roshan, a powerful neutral boss

## Gold and Experience

### Gold
Gold is the currency used to buy items. You earn gold by:
- **Passively** - Small amount over time
- **Last-hitting creeps** - Dealing the killing blow to enemy creeps
- **Killing heroes** - Large gold bonus
- **Destroying towers** - Team-wide gold bonus
- **Jungle farming** - Killing neutral creeps

### Experience (XP)
Experience levels up your hero, making abilities stronger. You gain XP by:
- Being near dying enemy creeps
- Killing or assisting in hero kills
- Killing neutral creeps

When you level up, you get a skill point to upgrade your abilities.

## Items and Shops

### Item Basics
Items enhance your hero by providing:
- Extra stats (damage, health, mana)
- Unique passive effects
- Active abilities

### Shops
- **Base Shop** - Located in your fountain, sells all items
- **Secret Shop** - Located in the jungle, sells special components
- **Side Shops** - Quick access to basic items (in lane)

### Item Progression
Most powerful items are built from cheaper components. For example:
1. Buy small items
2. Combine them into medium items
3. Combine those into powerful late-game items

## Roles

Each player typically fills one of these roles:

### Position 1 - Carry (Safe Lane)
- Farms gold to become powerful late-game
- Usually the team's main damage dealer
- Protected by supports early on

### Position 2 - Mid
- Plays alone in the middle lane
- Focuses on gaining a level advantage
- Often a playmaker who helps other lanes

### Position 3 - Offlaner
- Plays in the "hard lane" (harder to farm safely)
- Usually durable or disruptive heroes
- Creates space for the carry to farm

### Position 4 - Soft Support
- Roams the map helping all lanes
- Sets up kills with disables
- **Hoodwink often plays this role!**

### Position 5 - Hard Support
- Focuses entirely on helping the team
- Buys support items (wards, etc.)
- Protects the carry in lane

## Creeps and Last-Hitting

### What Are Creeps?
Creeps are AI-controlled units that spawn periodically and march down each lane. There are:
- **Lane Creeps** - Your creeps that fight enemy creeps
- **Neutral Creeps** - Monsters in the jungle

### Last-Hitting
**Last-hitting** means dealing the killing blow to an enemy creep. This is crucial because:
- You only get gold if YOU land the killing blow
- Missing last-hits means falling behind in gold

### Denying
You can attack your own creeps when they're low health. This:
- Denies the enemy gold
- Reduces their XP gain
- Is an advanced technique (don't worry about it initially)

## Towers and Barracks

### Towers
Towers are defensive structures that:
- Attack enemies automatically
- Deal heavy damage
- Provide vision of the area
- Must be destroyed in order (outer → middle → inner)

### Barracks (Rax)
Each lane has two barracks - one for melee creeps, one for ranged. Destroying them:
- Makes YOUR creeps in that lane stronger ("mega creeps" if all are destroyed)
- Provides a significant advantage
- Is a major objective after taking towers

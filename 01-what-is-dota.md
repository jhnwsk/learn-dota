# What is Dota 2?

Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve. It's one of the most popular competitive games in the world, with millions of players and professional tournaments offering millions of dollars in prize money.

## The Genre: MOBA

MOBA stands for **Multiplayer Online Battle Arena**. In this genre:
- Two teams compete against each other
- Each player controls a single powerful "hero"
- Teams work together to destroy the enemy base
- Matches typically last 30-50 minutes

## The Two Teams

Every Dota 2 match features two opposing teams:

### Radiant (Bottom-Left)
- Located in the southwest corner of the map
- Bright, nature-themed aesthetic
- Their base is surrounded by lush forests

### Dire (Top-Right)
- Located in the northeast corner of the map
- Dark, corrupted aesthetic
- Their base has a more ominous appearance

**Note:** Which side you play on doesn't affect gameplay balance - both sides are equally powerful.

## The Objective

The goal is simple: **Destroy the enemy team's Ancient**.

The Ancient is a large structure located deep within each team's base. To reach it, you must:
1. Destroy enemy towers protecting the lanes
2. Destroy at least one set of barracks
3. Fight through enemy defenses
4. Destroy the Ancient

The first team to destroy the enemy Ancient wins!

## 5v5 Format

Each team consists of **5 players**, and each player chooses one **hero** to control for the entire match. There are over 120 heroes to choose from, each with unique abilities and playstyles.

### What Makes Heroes Different?
- **Abilities** - Each hero has 4 unique abilities (3 basic + 1 ultimate)
- **Stats** - Heroes have different amounts of health, mana, and damage
- **Roles** - Heroes are suited for different jobs (damage dealer, support, etc.)

## What Makes Dota 2 Special?

### Depth and Complexity
Dota 2 is known for its incredible depth. There's always more to learn, even after thousands of hours of play.

### Teamwork
Success requires coordination with your team. Communication and cooperation are essential.

### No Pay-to-Win
All heroes are free to play. Purchases are purely cosmetic.

### Esports Scene
Dota 2 hosts "The International," one of the largest esports tournaments in the world.

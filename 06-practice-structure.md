# How to Practice Dota 2 Effectively

A structured approach to deliberate practice, starting with Hoodwink.

## The Problem with "Just Playing"

Most players grind games without focus. They improve slowly, if at all. Deliberate practice means isolating skills, drilling them, and reviewing performance. This guide gives you that structure.

## Phase 1: Mechanical Isolation (Demo Mode)

**Time:** 15-20 minute sessions

Load into Demo Mode and drill hero-specific mechanics without the cognitive load of a real game.

### Hoodwink Drills

1. **Q-W Combo on Moving Targets**
   - Spawn enemy heroes and give them movement speed
   - Practice Acorn Shot → Bushwhack until it's reflexive
   - Goal: Bushwhack should come out before you consciously "see" the tree spawn

2. **Sharpshooter Tracking**
   - Practice charging R while tracking moving targets
   - Drill partial charges - full charge isn't always optimal
   - Vary distances to learn damage falloff instinctively

3. **Scurry Escape Routes**
   - Place yourself in dangerous positions near tree lines
   - Practice Scurry + tree pathing to juke
   - Learn which tree clusters allow escapes and which are traps

### Why This Works

You're building muscle memory in isolation. When you're in a real game, these mechanics should be automatic, freeing your brain for decision-making.

## Phase 2: Laning Patterns (Bot Games)

**Focus:** First 10 minutes only. Restart after.

Don't play to win. Play to drill specific behaviors:

### What to Practice

- **Trading patterns**: When can you right-click the enemy and disengage cleanly? Hoodwink has 575 attack range and Scurry for escape. Punish enemies when they go for last hits.

- **Lane equilibrium**: Keep the creep wave where you want it while harassing. Don't just auto-attack the wave.

- **Kill threat recognition**: At level 3 with Q-W, you have kill potential. Practice identifying the exact moment when a kill is possible with your lane partner.

### The 10-Minute Rule

Restart after 10 minutes. The laning phase is where most games are decided at non-pro levels. Master it.

## Phase 3: Real Games with Single Focus

Pick **ONE thing** to focus on per game. Write it down before you queue.

### Example Focus Points

- "Land Bushwhack without Acorn setup" (for when Q is on cooldown)
- "Track enemy cooldowns before committing"
- "Position for Sharpshooter in teamfights"
- "Watch minimap every 3 seconds"
- "Call missing heroes out loud"

### Why Single Focus?

You can't improve everything at once. Trying to do so means improving nothing. Constrained focus creates real improvement.

Ignore your MMR during practice games. You're training, not competing.

## Phase 4: Replay Review

This is the multiplier that separates good players from great ones.

### Watch Every Death

For each death, ask:
1. Where was I positioned?
2. What information did I have but ignored?
3. When did this death become unavoidable? What happened 10 seconds before?

### Hoodwink-Specific Review Points

- Bushwhacks that missed due to tree positioning
- Sharpshooters that hit but were mistimed (held too long or released too early)
- Deaths where Scurry was available but unused or misused
- Teamfights where you were in the front instead of the back

## Practice Log

Track your practice. This turns random grinding into deliberate improvement.

```
Date       | Focus                  | Notes
-----------|------------------------|---------------------------------------
           | Q-W combo speed        |
           | Lane trading           |
           | Minimap awareness      |
           | Sharpshooter timing    |
           | Positioning            |
```

## Applying This to Other Heroes

The framework stays the same. Only the specific drills change.

1. **Isolate mechanics** in Demo Mode
2. **Drill laning patterns** in bot games
3. **Play with single-focus** constraints
4. **Review your deaths**

You're building a library of automated skills so your conscious mind can focus on the game, not the buttons.

## Pre-Ranked Checklist

Before jumping into ranked, you should be able to:

- [ ] Execute your hero's core combos without thinking
- [ ] Win or go even in lane against bots on hard difficulty
- [ ] Identify your deaths in replay and explain what went wrong
- [ ] Play 3+ games in a row with maintained focus
- [ ] Glance at minimap every few seconds habitually
